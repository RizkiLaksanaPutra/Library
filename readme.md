# Personal Book Library
Welcome! This repository showcases my learning journey through the Odin Project. Below, you'll find a summary of what I've accomplished and learned.

## Introduction
This project is part of my learning journey with the Odin Project. It includes knowledge that I have implemented to practice and improve my web development skills.

## Project Overview
The Personal Book Library is a web-based application that allows users to create and manage their own book collection. It features a user-friendly interface where users can add books with details like title, author, year, number of pages, and reading status. The library data is saved to local storage, ensuring that your book collection persists between browser sessions.

## Languages Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Lessons Learned
Throughout this project, I have learned:
- Creating and working with JavaScript object constructors
- Storing data using the browser's local storage
- Dynamic rendering of HTML content based on stored data
- Handling user input and form submissions
- Implementing event listeners for interactive UI elements
